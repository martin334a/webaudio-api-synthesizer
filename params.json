Up to the release of iOS6 this kind of implementation would not have been possible, and would have required different audio files, which would have made any musical (tempo-based) representation fairly difficult due to buffering and preloading of audio. A superimposed canvas allows for multi-touch interactions on the interface.\r\n\r\nSee video here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgcw2Vyg7cc\r\n\r\n![Piano screenshot on an iPad](http://www.rioleo.org/images/static/piano_screen.jpg)","tagline":"A matrix synthesizer using the Web Audio API and perfectly tuned for iOS6","google":""}
